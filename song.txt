Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't sleep at night 'cause I'm thinking of you
Alone with my thoughts, trapped in this bed
Know I'd give the world just to see you again

I'll believe it when I see it
'Cause you said you're moving on
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it
'Cause we both know you're not that strong


Few words for new branch
